good ol' config. will probably break computers that are not mine. feel free to browse through but don't expect anything good to happen if you actually install it.

you need GNU stow for installing the config symlinks, and a whole lot of other programs that these configs assume you have.

folders starting with "desktop_" or "laptop_" contain desktop/laptop specific configs

run ./install.py or ./install.py --laptop to make your new computer like my old computer
